## Description
This repository houses the source code for my coding portfolio page! This was made with React and Vite, and is all frontend. To give the 'Contact Me' form functionality, I enlisted EmailJS to get genuine emails with every response, in real time. I've made this in a way that I can easily revisit and update it later if need be.
