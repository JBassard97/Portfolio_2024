## Description
This repository houses the source code for my coding portfolio page! This was made with React and Vite, and is all frontend. This serves as a convenient place to display all of my hiring materials and showcase my projects in one place. Special attention has been made to ensure that this looks very good on all screen sizes. I've made this in a way that I can easily revisit and update it later if need be.
## Installation
To see the site live, visit the live link in 'Usage.' Otherwise if you'd like to run it locally, you can follow these simple steps:
  1. Clone the project from GitHub
  2. In the root directory of the repo, run `npm i` in the integrated terminal
  3. Build the dist folder with the custom script `npm run build`
  4. Start the Vite server with the command `npm run dev`
  5. Don't forget to enter `Ctrl + C` when you're done running the server
## Usage
Link to project: https://jacciarito-portfolio-2024.netlify.app/

When you load the application, you'll be greeted with an aesthetically pleasing background, a picture of myself, a brief description of my career journey, and a dreamy footer. This `About Me` section is shown in the middle by default. Hovering over each item in the navbar will reveal a dropdown. 

Selecting `My Story` under `About` will also show the `About Me` section, and selecting `Cover Letter` will show my cover letter explaining my experience and personal growth.

Selecting `Projects` under `Portfolio` will reveal a fun carousel that displays the projects I'm proudest of, each with a link for their GitHub repo and a link to its deployed site if it has one.

Under the `Contact` tab, the dropdown will reveal `Contact Form` and `Find me at...` When you select `Find me at...`, the middle will display my email, phone, and links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and npm profiles. Selecting `Contact Form` will display a form that when all of the fields have been filled correctly, will directly allow you to contact me. To give the 'Contact Me' form functionality, I enlisted EmailJS to get genuine emails with every form completion, in real time.

Under the `Resume` tab, the dropdown reveals `Skills`, `Preview`, and `Download`. Selecting `Skills` will display my skills and learned technologies, categorized by language, frontend, backend, or simply if I'm still learning it. `Preview` will display a simple PNG of my resume, and `Download` will open a new tab allowing you to download the full PDF.
