          As a recent graduate from the Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp at UNC Chapel
          Hill with a specialization in the MERN stack, I am excited about the
          opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge in a professional
          setting. In just six months, my journey through the coding bootcamp
          has been nothing short of transformative. The intensive curriculum and
          hands-on projects have equipped me with a strong foundation in modern
          web development technologies, including MongoDB, Express.js, React.js,
          and Node.js.
        </p>

          I have gained experience in building full-stack web applications,
          implementing RESTful APIs, and working with databases, among other key
          skills. Although my previous work experience has been in the food
          service industry, I believe that these experiences have provided me
          with valuable soft skills that are transferable to a career in
          technology. Through my roles in food service, I have honed my
          communication, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities, which I am
          eager to leverage in a new and challenging environment.
